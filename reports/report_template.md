# Report: Skin Cancer Classification with Deep Learning

### 1. Introduction

- **Problem Statement:** The challenge of accurately classifying skin lesions from dermoscopy images is critical for early diagnosis of skin cancer. Manual diagnosis can be subjective and time-consuming. This project aims to build an automated system using deep learning to assist dermatologists.
- **Objective:** To develop and evaluate a CNN-based model for multi-class classification of skin lesions, utilizing transfer learning for improved performance and generalizability.
- **Dataset:** The HAM10000 dataset was used, containing over 10,000 images across 7 categories of skin lesions.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Class Distribution:** *[Insert the class distribution plot from your EDA notebook]*
  - **Insight:** The dataset is highly imbalanced, with a significant majority of images belonging to the 'Melanocytic nevi' (nv) class. This imbalance must be addressed to prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
- **Patient Demographics:** *[Describe findings on age, gender, and localization of lesions. Insert plots if relevant.]*
  - **Insight:** The age distribution shows a peak around 40-50 years. Lesions are most commonly found on the back, lower extremity, and trunk.
- **Image Samples:** *[Show sample images of each class.]*
  - **Insight:** Visual inspection reveals subtle differences between classes, highlighting the difficulty of the task and the need for a powerful feature extractor like a deep CNN.

### 3. Methodology

#### 3.1. Data Preprocessing
- **Image Normalization:** Images were resized to 224x224 pixels to match the input size of the ResNet50 model. Pixel values were normalized using the `preprocess_input` function specific to ResNet50.
- **Data Augmentation:** To increase dataset diversity and reduce overfitting, the following augmentations were applied to the training set: random horizontal/vertical flips, random rotations, and slight adjustments to brightness and contrast.
- **Handling Class Imbalance:** We computed class weights inversely proportional to the frequency of each class in the training set. These weights were passed to the model's loss function, penalizing errors on minority classes more heavily.

#### 3.2. Model Architecture
- **Base Model:** We used the **ResNet50** architecture, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.
- **Transfer Learning:** The convolutional base of ResNet50 was used as a fixed feature extractor (layers were frozen).
- **Custom Classifier Head:** A custom head was added on top of the base model, consisting of:
  1. `GlobalAveragePooling2D`: To reduce the feature maps to a flat vector.
  2. `Dropout(0.5)`: For regularization.
  3. `Dense(256, activation='relu')`: An intermediate dense layer.
  4. `Dropout(0.5)`: More regularization.
  5. `Dense(7, activation='softmax')`: The final output layer for 7-class classification.

#### 3.3. Training Pipeline
- **Framework:** TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Optimizer:** Adam with an initial learning rate of 0.001.
- **Callbacks:**
  - `EarlyStopping`: Monitored `val_accuracy` with a patience of 5 epochs to prevent overfitting and stop training when performance plateaus.
  - `ReduceLROnPlateau`: Reduced the learning rate by a factor of 0.2 if `val_loss` did not improve for 3 epochs.
  - `ModelCheckpoint`: Saved only the best model weights based on `val_accuracy`.

### 4. Results and Evaluation

- **Performance Metrics:** The model was evaluated on a held-out test set.
  - *[Insert the classification report table from your evaluation script.]*
  - **Overall Accuracy:** [e.g., 85%]
- **Confusion Matrix:**
  - *[Insert the confusion matrix plot.]*
  - **Analysis:** The model performs well on the majority class 'nv'. There is some confusion between 'mel' (Melanoma) and 'nv', which is a clinically common challenge. The performance on rare classes like 'df' is lower due to the limited number of samples.
- **ROC-AUC:**
  - *[Insert the multi-class ROC curve plot.]*
  - **Analysis:** The macro-average ROC-AUC score of [e.g., 0.92] indicates strong discriminative ability across all classes. The curve for 'nv' is excellent, while curves for minority classes are closer to the diagonal, reflecting the classification difficulty.

- **Model Interpretability (Grad-CAM):**
  - *[Insert a few Grad-CAM examples for different classes.]*
  - **Analysis:** Grad-CAM visualizations show that the model correctly focuses on the lesion area rather than the surrounding skin or artifacts. This increases confidence in the model's decision-making process.

### 5. Conclusion and Future Work

- **Summary of Findings:** We successfully developed a deep learning pipeline that achieves promising results in skin cancer classification. Transfer learning proved effective, and handling class imbalance was crucial for achieving balanced performance.
- **Limitations:** The model's performance on under-represented classes is still limited. The dataset, while large, may not capture the full diversity of skin lesion presentations globally.
- **Future Work:**
  - **Fine-Tuning:** Unfreeze the top layers of the base model and fine-tune with a very low learning rate to potentially improve performance.
  - **Advanced Augmentation:** Experiment with CutMix or MixUp.
  - **Ensemble Methods:** Combine predictions from multiple architectures (e.g., ResNet50, EfficientNet, InceptionV3) to improve robustness.
  - **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use a framework like Optuna or KerasTuner to systematically search for optimal hyperparameters (learning rate, dropout rate, etc.).
